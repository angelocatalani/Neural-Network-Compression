# NN-project
Neural Network Project, Deep Compression with pruning, quantization and weight sharing.
## Abstract
Compressing a neural network with pruning and quantization with low loss of accuracy is the aim of this project.  
I have run my experiment on the MNIST classification problem, with the neural networks named : LeNet300-100 and LeNet5.
